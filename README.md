# üå± PlantDuino ‚Äì Automated Irrigation with ESP8266 and Telegram

**PlantDuino** is an automated plant irrigation system powered by an **ESP8266** microcontroller, enabling real-time monitoring and remote control of watering through **Telegram**. This project was developed by first-year Computer Engineering students at the **University of Concepci√≥n, Chile**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The system continuously monitors soil moisture using an **HW-080 sensor** placed at root level. If moisture falls below a defined threshold, the system activates a **water pump** to restore adequate hydration. It also sends notifications via Telegram and allows users to control irrigation remotely.

Two operational modes are included:

### üß≠ Standard Mode
- Manual or remote irrigation via Telegram commands.
- Users can specify the volume of water to be dispensed.
- The system calculates pump run time based on prior flow calibration to deliver the precise amount.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Travel Mode
- Fully automated irrigation.
- Users define target **minimum and maximum soil moisture values**.
- When moisture drops below the minimum, the system irrigates until the target value is reached ‚Äî without requiring user input.

In both modes, the system allows remote monitoring of:
- Real-time soil moisture percentage.
- Last irrigation details.
- Current system status.
